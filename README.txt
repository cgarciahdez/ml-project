This is the help section for the program.

Before attempting to run either algorithm, it's necessary that you choose one of the
datasets to load it. To do so, please choose the load a dataset option in the main menu and 
choose whichever dataset you want. To see the results gotten from this datasets before
choosing one, please go to the static results section, where you will be able to see the
time they took and their performance. It is recommended that you do this so as not to 
run one of the long lasting algorithms by accident. If you do, and want to force end the 
program, you will have to press ctr+c.

You also have the option to change the inputs for the GNCC algorithm. Please be aware
that changing them drastically might make the program run for a much longer time. We 
do not recommend choosing a very small step, a very big number of maximum iterations, or 
a very small acceptable error.

Finally, you have the option to run the algorithms separately or both of them to copare.
Be aware that the GNCC algorith takes a longer time than the OGCNN. To see the times
gotten during the making of the report, please refer to the static results.
