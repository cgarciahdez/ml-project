to run, use

    python3 hw3_head.py

It assumes that the data is in the folder

    ./data/
    ./data/iris.data
    ./data/optdigits.tes
    ./data/optdigits.tra

Please make sure these directories exist and have the proper datasets if you are having problems.

I used the:
Iris Dataset
Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data set

for this assignment. Please have all the data where the code expects it.

Sample results are in sample_results.txt

It gives a deprecation error for the data, but I am able to run it.
I recommend writing the output to a file instead of attempting to view it in the window.
I could not finish the Feed Forward Network. It was giving me a shaping error with Hidden Layer's output which I could not remedy.
